### Material relating to my [ISBA 2021](https://events.stat.uconn.edu/ISBA2021/) presentation

## A compositional approach to Bayesian computation

* Talk: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PKT2YUV_ps), [slides](Talk/talk-PREBUILT.pdf), [markdown](Talk/talk.md)
* A longer (2 hour) [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcLtA4TTzh8) (and [slides](https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/d.j.wilkinson/teaching/apts-sc/ctfp.pdf)) covering similar ideas, but in more detail, with code examples (in Scala)

### Papers

* Law, J. & Wilkinson, D.J. (2019) [Functional probabilistic programming for scalable Bayesian modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02062), in submission.

### Languages

* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) - modern, strict functional language
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - old, lazy functional language
* [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) - interesting language with good FP support
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - not functional, but interesting anyway
* [Dex](https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang) - experimental FP language for differentiable array programming, with ML applications in mind
